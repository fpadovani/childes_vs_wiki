uh ca ca .,6277,16.8,0
uh poo excuse me .,6277,16.8,0
i walked in and saw it .,6277,16.8,0
and ross looked at me and he said .,6277,16.8,0
and then he said !,6277,16.8,0
how did he say it ?,6277,16.8,0
let's hear how he said it .,6277,16.8,0
oh he mushed it !,6277,16.8,0
he said oh no .,6277,16.8,0
the goodness was mushed but the oh was clear .,6277,16.8,0
was that clear .,6277,16.8,0
it was pretty clear considering i i understood .,6277,16.8,0
and i was sort of listening .,6277,16.8,0
i was trying to figure out what that one was but that was clear too .,6277,16.8,0
it was clear enough .,6277,16.8,0
he doesn't say anything clear .,6277,16.8,0
he says don't very clearly .,6277,16.8,0
he says unt .,6277,16.8,0
he says du .,6277,16.8,0
well he doesn't say it clearly though .,6277,16.8,0
he doesn't say don't .,6277,16.8,0
pretty clear .,6277,16.8,0
and then and then just a few minutes ago i gave him a piece of coconut which he had been pointing at and wanting .,6277,16.8,0
and so i gave it to him .,6277,16.8,0
and he said thank you .,6277,16.8,0
mary wants to tell us a story about mike spratt .,6277,16.8,0
i think he means mine .,6277,16.8,0
you want to tell us a story about mike spratt now mary .,6277,16.8,0

and as soon as ross realized that uh i'm not sure this is such a good story .,6277,16.8,0
tell it ?,6277,16.8,0
as soon as mike re ross realized that mike was there he began to bring him the uh leggo dolls .,6277,16.8,0
one by one !,6277,16.8,0
and then he became uh began became involved in a game with mike .,6277,16.8,0
where mike would um this was very nonverbal ?,6277,16.8,0
ross would put the doll oh i know he wanted all the doll back from mike that was it .,6277,16.8,0
after he gave them all to him .,6277,16.8,0
so he'd take them one by one !,6277,16.8,0
well at least he took the first one and then he'd put it on the window sill ?,6277,16.8,0
then he asked mike for the next one and mike gave it to him .,6277,16.8,0
and he asked mike for the third one but mike would not give him the third one until ross put the second one on the window sill also .,6277,16.8,0
uh and he tried i guess mike guided his hand that time .,6277,16.8,0
so the third and fourth time around ross got the hang of the game .,6277,16.8,0

it's just like a big massive vine but in the spring all these flowers come out ?,5852,28.3,1
and they have to be in sunlight but in the shade you know what like the sun needs to beat down on the exterior but not the roots .,5852,28.3,1
it's this weird thing so it's hard to grown but ?,5852,28.3,1
come sit with me .,5852,28.3,1
oh boy look what we have .,5852,28.3,1
dora's backpack and the little mermaid which one should we read first .,5852,28.3,1
alright the little mermaid ?,5852,28.3,1
mommy has to yawn she's tired .,5852,28.3,1
under the sea was a bustling kingdom of mer people presided over by the just and noble king .,5852,28.3,1
triton .,5852,28.3,1
king tritan forbade the mer people to go above the water but whenever his youngest daughter ariel could she and her best friend flounder would sneak up the surface .,5852,28.3,1
ariel was fascinated by the surface world and had a collection of human treasures .,5852,28.3,1
she and flounder had even made friends with a seagull named scuttle ?,5852,28.3,1
one day ariel saw a ship overhead and swam to the surface ?,5852,28.3,1
on board was a handsome young man called ?,5852,28.3,1
prince eric .,5852,28.3,1
all of a sudden a storm broke and the sky turned dark thunder boomed and lightening crashed .,5852,28.3,1
howling wind tore at the ship's sails and giant waves tossed the vessel onto the jagged rocks ?,5852,28.3,1
prince eric was thrown into the ocean ?,5852,28.3,1
ariel frantically searched for the prince and when she spotted him she quickly swam over to him and pulled him to safety ?,5852,28.3,1
once they were on shore ariel sang quietly to the unconscious prince .,5852,28.3,1
at last he began to awaken minutes later the prince's servant sir grimsby discovered him a girl rescued me said the prince groggily and she had the most beautiful voice ?,5852,28.3,1
she has a very pretty voice was she singing ?,5852,28.3,1
who else likes to sing ?,5852,28.3,1
ursula ?,5852,28.3,1
is she nice or is she mean ?,5852,28.3,1
she is mean .,5852,28.3,1
meanwhile in a dark corner of the sea lay the lair of ursula the sea witch she had been bent on destroying king tritan ever since he had thrown her out of his kingdom ?,5852,28.3,1
she stared at the image of ariel and flounder in her crystal ball this pretty little daughter of his may be the key to tritan's undoing she said .,5852,28.3,1
when ariel returned home tritan was very angry with her ?,5852,28.3,1
never go there again he said and he .,5852,28.3,1
that is his triton he holds ?,5852,28.3,1
and he destroyed all of ariel's human treasures ariel had that ariel had collected from the surface ?,5852,28.3,1
ariel was very upset and she sought ursula's help .,5852,28.3,1
in exchange for the mermaid's voice ursula would transform ariel's tail into legs ?,5852,28.3,1
but she said the prince must fall in love with you by sunset on the third day that is he's got to kiss you ?,5852,28.3,1
if not .,5852,28.3,1
well she's gonna ?,5852,28.3,1
ursula took her mermaid tail away and gave her legs instead right ?,5852,28.3,1
and if prince eric didn't kiss her on the third day ariel would change back into a mermaid and become ursula's slave forever .,5852,28.3,1
a short time later prince eric and his dog max found ariel on the beach ?,5852,28.3,1
you seem very familiar to me he said have we met .,5852,28.3,1
ariel could only nod although she looked like the girl who had rescued him it eric thought it couldn't be her because she couldn't speak much less sing ?,5852,28.3,1
don't worry i'll help you said eric and he brought ariel back to his castle ?,5852,28.3,1
but meanwhile ursula hatched a plan to keep eric from falling in love with ariel she turned herself into a pretty girl named ?,5852,28.3,1
vanessa right .,5852,28.3,1
and she wore the shell containing ariel's voice around her neck ?,5852,28.3,1
that evening the prince heard someone singing it was the voice of the girl who had saved him ?,5852,28.3,1
eric went out to the balcony and saw vanessa and fell under her wicked spell ?,5852,28.3,1
when ariel awoke the next morning she saw eric with vanessa ?,5852,28.3,1
ariel had lost her chance and was doomed to be ursula's slave forever .,5852,28.3,1
that's deborah going to work .,5852,28.3,1
aboard the wedding ship scuttle saw vanessa's reflection in the mirror and realized it was really ursula ?,5852,28.3,1
scuttle and the other seagulls did their best to interrupt the wedding by flying at vanessa .,5852,28.3,1
this is one the ship ?,5852,28.3,1
a magic locket fell to the ground and shattered just as ariel reached the ship .,5852,28.3,1
um that looks like a little flower or something and this is some smoke maybe ?,5852,28.3,1
oh that's right that's the necklace that broke you're absolutely right .,5852,28.3,1
i'll call her back .,5852,28.3,1
um you can talk said prince you're the one it was you all the time .,5852,28.3,1
happy at last the prince leaned over to kiss ariel but seconds before the kiss the sun set .,5852,28.3,1
you're too late shouted ursula ariel looked down and saw that her legs had changed back into a tail ?,5852,28.3,1
it's not you i'm after said ursula i've got bigger fish to fry .,5852,28.3,1
and at those words king tritan appeared .,5852,28.3,1
in return for his daughter's freedom the king agreed to take ariel's place as ursula's slave ?,5852,28.3,1
at last this is mine ursula cried placing ?,5852,28.3,1
right that's her ?,5852,28.3,1
that's ariel's daddy's crown and his triton .,5852,28.3,1
ursula grew monstrously huge but suddenly prince eric appeared steering his ship through the raging waves right at ursula .,5852,28.3,1
and the bough of the ship pierced her cold heart slowly the horrible sea witch sank beneath the waves forever ?,5852,28.3,1
king tritan's powers were restored and he realized how happy eric and ariel were ?,5852,28.3,1
with his triton he changed ariel's tail back into legs ?,5852,28.3,1
what's what's this one about ?,5852,28.3,1
belle ?,5852,28.3,1
the beast .,5852,28.3,1
a young woman named belle lived near the castle .,5852,28.3,1
belle loved to read more than anything in the world .,5852,28.3,1
who else loves to read ?,5852,28.3,1
you do like to read ?,5852,28.3,1
uh her father maurice was busy working on a new invention you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow belle predicted ?,5852,28.3,1
but maurice and his horse philippe never made it to the fair they got lost and saw a castle ?,5852,28.3,1
maurice approached the castle and stepped inside ?,5852,28.3,1
suddenly a huge beast stormed into the room a stranger he gravled growled and dragged maurice into the dungeon .,5852,28.3,1
at that very moment gaston a local hunter had arrived at belle's house to propose marriage ?,5852,28.3,1
say you'll marry me he said but belle refused there was no way she'd marry that conceited bully ?,5852,28.3,1
gaston left angrily ?,5852,28.3,1
just then philippe arrived with no rider where's papa ?,5852,28.3,1
you must take me to him ?,5852,28.3,1
i don't suppose she's french so maybe she just said where's papa huh .,5852,28.3,1
belle rode through the forest braving the thick fog and frightening sounds when she found the castle ?,5852,28.3,1
i'm the master of this castle roared the beast ?,5852,28.3,1
take me instead of my father said belle .,5852,28.3,1
and the beast agreed there's the beast .,5852,28.3,1
you can go anywhere you like he said to belle except the west wing and you will join me for dinner .,5852,28.3,1
back at the castle the beast waited for belle to join him for dinner master said lumiere this girl could be the one to break the spell ?,5852,28.3,1
she'll always see me as a monster grumbled the beast .,5852,28.3,1
but one day at dinner the beast remembered his manners and later he and belle shared a wonderful dance .,5852,28.3,1
the beast asked belle if she was happy .,5852,28.3,1
oh yes said belle if only i could see my father ?,5852,28.3,1
so the beast brought belle a magic mirror and her father appeared in it .,5852,28.3,1
but he was wondering lost in the forest you must go to him said the beast sadly but take the mirror so you can remember me .,5852,28.3,1
she left the castle and found her father and brought him home .,5852,28.3,1
but suddenly gaston arrived with an angry crowd your father's crazy he think thinks he's seen a beast .,5852,28.3,1
but belle had to convince everyone her father was not crazy so she picked up the magic mirror and showed the beast to the crowd .,5852,28.3,1
gaston locked belle and her father in the cellar and set off to find the beast .,5852,28.3,1
she's in her house .,5852,28.3,1
belle and her father escaped from the cellar and also began riding towards the castle .,5852,28.3,1
when belle and her father arrived the beast had gaston by the throat ?,5852,28.3,1
let me go cried gaston and the beast felt sorry for him and released him .,5852,28.3,1
that's right they are wearing capes ?,5852,28.3,1
uh oh right ?,5852,28.3,1
as the beast embraced belle gaston stabbed him in the back and the beast let out a terrible roar .,5852,28.3,1
gaston tripped and fell off the balcony and was never to be seen again .,5852,28.3,1
the beast collapsed in belle's arms you came back he said at least i got to see you one more time .,5852,28.3,1
belle began to cry .,5852,28.3,1
oh no please said belle i love you .,5852,28.3,1
it's me he said to belle and all the household servants became human too .,5852,28.3,1

get down off the bed and go out and tell daddy you're sorry .,6281,28.3,1
and he said it very nicely .,6281,28.3,1
and this morning speaking of politeness and all that .,6281,28.3,1
he climbed up on the chair and asked me for something .,6281,28.3,1
very nicely .,6281,28.3,1
and now i'm telling him to stop whining .,6281,28.3,1
i don't want you whining .,6281,28.3,1
for example i'm going downstairs .,6281,28.3,1
basically if you agree to do what he wants .,6281,28.3,1
uh something nice .,6281,28.3,1
and you tell him stops whining .,6281,28.3,1
he'll stop whining .,6281,28.3,1
he'll stop .,6281,28.3,1
if you don't tell him to stop whining he'll continue .,6281,28.3,1
you've gotta be very explicit in what you say .,6281,28.3,1
i was fooling with his nose and he said .,6281,28.3,1
he doesn't want no more help daddy .,6281,28.3,1
i got that coming up .,6281,28.3,1
he wanted me to get his stick .,6281,28.3,1
he was outside and he wanted to come in .,6281,28.3,1
and we were watching tv oh here's marky .,6281,28.3,1
that's not marky .,6281,28.3,1
okay what will mark talk about ?,6281,28.3,1
we saw the gonk and the glimore something on tv .,6281,28.3,1
these are some wug type nonsense creatures nonsense muppets .,6281,28.3,1
lived on some silly planet .,6281,28.3,1
and about two hours later he asked me .,6281,28.3,1
he really wanted the gonk .,6281,28.3,1
that's marky in the background .,6281,28.3,1
i thought that was rather nice .,6281,28.3,1
he just learned the word seth .,6281,28.3,1
and did it rather nicely in a little sentence .,6281,28.3,1
not to roady .,6281,28.3,1
and this was a lie .,6281,28.3,1
because he had run out to try to find me .,6281,28.3,1
because he thought i was driving away .,6281,28.3,1
and i got out there and caught him in the act of looking for me .,6281,28.3,1
and also being out in the front yard where he's not supposed to be .,6281,28.3,1
i think he was really lying basically .,6281,28.3,1
he wasn't doing pee pee on the grass ?,6281,28.3,1
no no he tried .,6281,28.3,1
go ahead and do it .,6281,28.3,1
because he didn't want to in the first place .,6281,28.3,1
he didn't want to do pee pee .,6281,28.3,1
he calls his bottle flintstones .,6281,28.3,1
means i don't want my bottle .,6281,28.3,1
may i say that last week it was barney .,6281,28.3,1
yeah he calls it barney .,6281,28.3,1
and calls it bottle and now it's flintstones .,6281,28.3,1
he's got lots of names for it .,6281,28.3,1
he's changing around a lot .,6281,28.3,1
yeah he has names for his bottle .,6281,28.3,1
um he was looking for spoons or pencils i guess .,6281,28.3,1
as if i want another also or i want another one too .,6281,28.3,1
i wasn't sure .,6281,28.3,1
i want one too i'm not sure .,6281,28.3,1
he might be confusing those .,6281,28.3,1
yeah that's what i was thinking .,6281,28.3,1
he's very into numbers .,6281,28.3,1
two and two right .,6281,28.3,1
i heard that sort of confusion before .,6281,28.3,1
i want it too .,6281,28.3,1
what was that mary ?,6281,28.3,1
what you found ?,6281,28.3,1
okay something .,6281,28.3,1
i'm going to take off your pants .,6281,28.3,1
so it looked like he was building it up out of the units .,6281,28.3,1
don't take off .,6281,28.3,1
don't take off my pants .,6281,28.3,1
and then he kind of readjusted because he like it better with the idea that off would follow pants .,6281,28.3,1
so don't take my pants off .,6281,28.3,1
he likes that better .,6281,28.3,1
so he kind of correct himself essentially to that .,6281,28.3,1
and i was cleaning his nose a lot this morning and trying to fix him up .,6281,28.3,1
he was having a lot of problems .,6281,28.3,1
giving him medicine .,6281,28.3,1
giving him medicine right .,6281,28.3,1
and he really was getting unhappy .,6281,28.3,1
we told me we were trying to help him .,6281,28.3,1
trying to help him .,6281,28.3,1
try to help him feel better .,6281,28.3,1
but that was later .,6281,28.3,1

he smokes a pencil and what did he smoke this morning a teaspoon ?,6281,28.3,1
three times very insistently .,6281,28.3,1

and then she had told me she was taking a little vacation last week .,6915,30.8,1
i think she was with a patient when she told me this over the phone .,6915,30.8,1
but she went into the hospital and i had heard i uh that she was pretty sick .,6915,30.8,1
and that she was ?,6915,30.8,1
she told me today she has cancer ?,6915,30.8,1
a woman in her fiftys with i think five kids mostly married a couple in their teens .,6915,30.8,1
what kind of cancer ?,6915,30.8,1
it wasn't too clear .,6915,30.8,1
she's got it in her mediastinum which is the area between her lungs .,6915,30.8,1
the area of lymph nodes .,6915,30.8,1
it's probably probably a lung cancer .,6915,30.8,1

i would think so ?,6915,30.8,1
she's uh ?,6915,30.8,1
the woman well the woman she works with who she's been friendly with she has not been able to tell ?,6915,30.8,1
she says she's afraid if she tells them everyone comes to work and thus takes her mind uh remind her of it ?,6915,30.8,1
why'd she tell you ?,6915,30.8,1
well i think it was because our meeting was at the end of the day ?,6915,30.8,1
and that she told me she has been straining to keep up a facade all day ?,6915,30.8,1
and couldn't do it any longer .,6915,30.8,1
she kind of apologized she thought she was being unprofessional in telling me .,6915,30.8,1
which is part .,6915,30.8,1
of her self abnegating nature ?,6915,30.8,1
also i think she you know being a doctor she .,6915,30.8,1
is she a doctor .,6915,30.8,1
no my being a doctor ?,6915,30.8,1
she wanted a little medical advice ?,6915,30.8,1
did you hear of her doctors ?,6915,30.8,1
i heard of one of em ?,6915,30.8,1
i suggested a consultation to discuss .,6915,30.8,1
not that that's necessarily an indication of anything .,6915,30.8,1
why don't you taste this just again so you can see how good it is .,6915,30.8,1
it's ice cold ?,6915,30.8,1
you better eat those scallops .,6915,30.8,1

did you tell daddy who was here today working in the kitchen .,6915,30.8,1
well give him a chance to chew it .,6915,30.8,1
or else he's gonna end up with a mouthful and s p i t .,6915,30.8,1
scallops .,6915,30.8,1
it's hard to eat them even cause they're so .,6915,30.8,1
they're rich ?,6915,30.8,1
rich ?,6915,30.8,1
but you may still be hungry nonetheless .,6915,30.8,1
like chinese food ?,6915,30.8,1
chinese food you don't you don't feel hungry till later ?,6915,30.8,1
what restaurant ?,6915,30.8,1
chinese restaurant .,6915,30.8,1
is that your favorite .,6915,30.8,1
whadiya like to eat there .,6915,30.8,1
do you like egg roll ?,6915,30.8,1
you want some more potato .,6915,30.8,1
say the that bread it didn't rise much but yet it tastes okay .,6915,30.8,1
the texture of it looks even you know .,6915,30.8,1
i don't know what the hell's wrong with that .,6915,30.8,1
i made it a half a dozen times .,6915,30.8,1
maybe freezing it does it .,6915,30.8,1
well but i buy it frozen .,6915,30.8,1
i i've read that .,6915,30.8,1
cause you did refrozen maybe .,6915,30.8,1
well i've read that it's hard to refreeze dough properly .,6915,30.8,1
but i never had any problems with this pepperidge farm stuff and then the last couple a batches i really let em rise i make ?,6915,30.8,1
it happened last time .,6915,30.8,1
i thought i didn't let it rise enough .,6915,30.8,1
but i left it out for seven hours ?,6915,30.8,1
it said two or three .,6915,30.8,1
to really double in bulk you know i left it out overnight .,6915,30.8,1
of course when i made it .,6915,30.8,1
whatsa the matter ?,6915,30.8,1
when i made it successfully it was in the summer and that made a difference ?,6915,30.8,1
that in the warmer weather it would rise better ?,6915,30.8,1
well i'll leave it out forever and ever next time .,6915,30.8,1
well in the kitchen it's out of the freezer .,6915,30.8,1
yeah but i left it in here and i put it on the radiator for five hours .,6915,30.8,1
so you know it ought to handle it .,6915,30.8,1
how about your potatos ?,6915,30.8,1
you gonna eat those potatos .,6915,30.8,1
how about these scallops ?,6915,30.8,1
shall i eat one .,6915,30.8,1
we spill at least once a day if not twice .,6915,30.8,1
i think this is the third time today ?,6915,30.8,1
this morning we had to change his pants because he had orange juice all over them .,6915,30.8,1
i must say the spilling is much quieter because you don't swear when the tape recorder's on .,6915,30.8,1
that isn't true ?,6915,30.8,1
i wasn't restraining myself .,6915,30.8,1
i was too tired to swear .,6915,30.8,1
martin daddy's eating your scallops .,6915,30.8,1
well that's silly .,6915,30.8,1
say don't do that daddy .,6915,30.8,1
oh here it goes here it goes unless .,6915,30.8,1
martin did you tell daddy who was working in the kitchen today .,6915,30.8,1
and cleopatra .,6915,30.8,1
an and a brick man ?,6915,30.8,1
brick man !,6915,30.8,1
mason the brick man .,6915,30.8,1
you know ned proposed to let to use that same roof that's already out there ?,6915,30.8,1
that was my idea .,6915,30.8,1
and he was bitching and moaning about oh no it'd be so much work .,6915,30.8,1
i oh uh it'd be harder !,6915,30.8,1
he was bitching and moaning about everything .,6915,30.8,1
uh hee .,6915,30.8,1
i'd rather he didn't leave it .,6915,30.8,1
i'd rather have a different kind of roof .,6915,30.8,1
oh you would .,6915,30.8,1
i thought it would be cheaper .,6915,30.8,1
this is gonna look dumb .,6915,30.8,1
and he wants to put another on of those .,6915,30.8,1
you go out and take a look .,6915,30.8,1
first of all the roof looks dumb ?,6915,30.8,1
it really does look dumb ?,6915,30.8,1
over those sliding glass doors ?,6915,30.8,1
but he didn't wa he didn't know ?,6915,30.8,1
what to do about ?,6915,30.8,1
the other side anyways .,6915,30.8,1
and he's gonna put in a pillar even though the pillar might block the view .,6915,30.8,1
well he we discussed it remember .,6915,30.8,1
he said if you're building a deck that'll be you know two hundred dollars .,6915,30.8,1
if you wanna put a roof on he's gotta put in concrete footings a foundation cause it's gottaar a lot of .,6915,30.8,1
you know what he's gonna do now .,6915,30.8,1
cause it's gotta bear a lotta weight to put up columns and then bear the weight of the roof .,6915,30.8,1
you know what he's gonna do now .,6915,30.8,1
he's gonna use the steps as the foundation .,6915,30.8,1
he really wants it to be concrete back there is what it comes right down to .,6915,30.8,1
and he'd like to use the the steps rather than take them down .,6915,30.8,1
he'd like to use them as the foundation .,6915,30.8,1
if he's gonna cut .,6915,30.8,1
he'll build a deck right out .,6915,30.8,1
well the thing .,6915,30.8,1
we were gonna do that that's fine .,6915,30.8,1
except those steps are too high that's what he told me .,6915,30.8,1
so what's he gonna do about that ?,6915,30.8,1
raise the house up ?,6915,30.8,1
cause the problem is about that is you have a mini step and then you have a step that's too big and that's that's part of why martin trips coming down there ?,6915,30.8,1
i don't want have it if someone's gonna trip .,6915,30.8,1
right on the concrete .,6915,30.8,1
you don't care if it's under the deck .,6915,30.8,1
no i don't care if it's under the deck .,6915,30.8,1
where's my napkin ?,6915,30.8,1
my napkin just got copted here .,6915,30.8,1
well there's the kleenex right behind you .,6915,30.8,1
and there's a towel right behind you .,6915,30.8,1
and there's napkins underneath the table ?,6915,30.8,1
martin what is it you want ?,6915,30.8,1
why do not you you eat those potatos ?,6915,30.8,1
you did a very nice job .,6915,30.8,1
you ate all your scallops and your salad .,6915,30.8,1
why do not you you eat some potato .,6915,30.8,1
what's the red stuff on the floor here ?,6915,30.8,1
yeah but daddy didn't eat too many of em .,6915,30.8,1
there's chopped up .,6915,30.8,1

it's not it's that it's that grease cut so it's even worse .,6915,30.8,1

robert pointed it out to me .,6915,30.8,1
yeah lunchtime .,6915,30.8,1
daddy's been stooping !,6915,30.8,1
he was stooping down to pick up the crayon that was ground into the floor !,6915,30.8,1
i think we're gonna have to take crayons away from him except for uh .,6915,30.8,1
oh good luck .,6915,30.8,1
well if he leaves em all around they're underfoot you're always stepping on em !,6915,30.8,1
i think we're gonna have to k keep em .,6915,30.8,1
well maybe if ?,6915,30.8,1
away where he can have em to draw then give them back .,6915,30.8,1
maybe if he had some kind of box that he could be encouraged to keep them in .,6915,30.8,1
uh do you think you could keep your crayons in a box all the time .,6915,30.8,1
except when you're using them .,6915,30.8,1
cause you know the way you have them now they're always on the floor ?,6915,30.8,1
and people step on them and they break and get lost .,6915,30.8,1

i think we've got a pretty good pooh there .,5805,31.3,1
his face is not quite right .,5805,31.3,1
maybe we didn't mush it in enough .,5805,31.3,1
maybe we need to use a rolling pin ?,5805,31.3,1
the rolling pins are over there .,5805,31.3,1
now i think you need to roll it on top .,5805,31.3,1
to push all the playdoh in .,5805,31.3,1
no on top of here .,5805,31.3,1
so make sure all the playdoh gets smushed down yeah .,5805,31.3,1

don't feel awful about your falafel ?,5805,31.3,1
okay ethan you think this one might be better .,5805,31.3,1
because we used the rolling pin .,5805,31.3,1
let's see here's the flat one .,5805,31.3,1
that's one's better ?,5805,31.3,1
now he has a face .,5805,31.3,1
why don't you make pooh a waffle .,5805,31.3,1
dayja stop it .,5805,31.3,1
should we let dayja in .,5805,31.3,1
maybe dayja's lonely .,5805,31.3,1
and wants to be where somebody loves him best of all .,5805,31.3,1
come on in silly ?,5805,31.3,1
just don't eat the playdoh .,5805,31.3,1
no dayja ?,5805,31.3,1
good dog .,5805,31.3,1
dayja gets lonely very easily .,5805,31.3,1
you're gonna make a busy buzzy bee good idea .,5805,31.3,1
you can sit down dayja .,5805,31.3,1
and pooh would say if there's a bee around i know there must be some honey .,5805,31.3,1
if there's a bee around i know there must be honey .,5805,31.3,1
so i'm going to follow that busy buzzing bee .,5805,31.3,1
it flew right next to pooh's ear that's right .,5805,31.3,1
should we make some honey for pooh .,5805,31.3,1
this is supposed to be a honey pot .,5805,31.3,1
i'm gonna push down really hard .,5805,31.3,1
come on pooh there's some honey for you .,5805,31.3,1
yeah i let dayja in because dayja was crying .,5805,31.3,1
dayja wanted company ?,5805,31.3,1
dayja didn't want to be alone .,5805,31.3,1
i looked in but the honey pot was empty .,5805,31.3,1
i bet it's going to rain today ethan .,5805,31.3,1
poor pooh he's gonna have to climb a honey tree or something huh .,5805,31.3,1
and what did the bee say .,5805,31.3,1
and the bee replied .,5805,31.3,1
should we make a tree out of playdoh ?,5805,31.3,1
we don't have the right colors for a tree but we can make a green tree ?,5805,31.3,1
with a yellow top ?,5805,31.3,1
you wanna make a green tree ?,5805,31.3,1
and then we'll have some yellow leaves on top .,5805,31.3,1
you want a hole for the owl ?,5805,31.3,1
we need a tool to make the hole in the tree .,5805,31.3,1
maybe the knife will do .,5805,31.3,1
instead of a brown bottom and a green top we need a special magical tree ?,5805,31.3,1
but it won't stay up .,5805,31.3,1
there's the hole though ?,5805,31.3,1
maybe it's where the bees live .,5805,31.3,1
and pooh can reach in there and get some honey .,5805,31.3,1
maybe you could use the knife again .,5805,31.3,1
put it down on the mat !,5805,31.3,1
yeah that's a good idea sweetie .,5805,31.3,1
do you want me to help you cut it away ?,5805,31.3,1
the extra is going away now .,5805,31.3,1
it's getting smaller so it's almost at the bee isn't it .,5805,31.3,1
and so it's almost just a bumble bee now .,5805,31.3,1
is that good or you want it smaller even .,5805,31.3,1
it's good to take the extra off before .,5805,31.3,1

in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting board .,5961,31.4,1

mushroom hunt ?,5866,31.9,1
early fall is the best time to go i didn't know this honey .,5866,31.9,1
early fall is the best time to go hunting for toadstools and mushrooms ?,5866,31.9,1
we should tell daddy that ?,5866,31.9,1
you can find an astonishing variety in fields and forests and even in gardens .,5866,31.9,1
toadstools and mushrooms are fungi ?,5866,31.9,1
these are plants that don't have any leaves or flowers but send tiny threads down into other plants or animal uh other plants or animal dung and feed on them ?,5866,31.9,1
some fungi grow on dead leaves and others grow on tree trunks or dead logs ?,5866,31.9,1
here are some to look for !,5866,31.9,1
cepes !,5866,31.9,1
also known as the porcini i believe .,5866,31.9,1
has a dark brown cap with pores underneath instead of gills .,5866,31.9,1
ooh this is a poisonous one we are not allowed to eat that one ?,5866,31.9,1
let's see which ones look like the ones that we see ?,5866,31.9,1
look at that giant puff ball ?,5866,31.9,1
it's a giant puff ball mushroom ?,5866,31.9,1
dryad's saddle has a pale yellow brown cap with darker scales .,5866,31.9,1
and a crimson wax cap is red .,5866,31.9,1
that's right that's a honey fungus mushroom ?,5866,31.9,1
yeah ooh this mushroom is called a stink horn and it has a nasty strong smell p u .,5866,31.9,1
yeah look at those and these are called chanterelle mushrooms .,5866,31.9,1
mm this is called a parasol ?,5866,31.9,1
because it looks like an umbrella ?,5866,31.9,1
sweetie can you eat some of your .,5866,31.9,1
cinnamon toast .,5866,31.9,1
look this is all about spiders honey ?,5866,31.9,1
is that tasty !,5866,31.9,1
spiders spin webs to catch insects ?,5866,31.9,1
different spiders have different types of webs .,5866,31.9,1
they don't look so nice you don't think ?,5866,31.9,1
do the spiders look very nice ?,5866,31.9,1
how small ?,5866,31.9,1
that spider's trying to eat that bug .,5866,31.9,1
how spiders spin sheet webs in the corners of rooms ?,5866,31.9,1
many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you have to plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand ?,5866,31.9,1
you can plant them in a garden or in pots ?,5866,31.9,1
you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months ?,5866,31.9,1
indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside .,5866,31.9,1
hm pretty .,5866,31.9,1
uh chocolate cobweb cake .,5866,31.9,1
make this delicious cake for a fall party or celebration .,5866,31.9,1
it is very easy .,5866,31.9,1
yeah a little spider ?,5866,31.9,1
all of the ingredients are mixed together in the same bowl ?,5866,31.9,1
that looks good doesn't it .,5866,31.9,1
chocolate right .,5866,31.9,1
that is a chocolate cake .,5866,31.9,1
as the days grow shorter and colder in the fall some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter .,5866,31.9,1
oh a butterfly how pretty that's called a monarch butterfly .,5866,31.9,1
look at that funny bird !,5866,31.9,1
oh that's a swallow ?,5866,31.9,1
that little bird !,5866,31.9,1
and this is a hoopoe apparently ?,5866,31.9,1
well uh some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter in warmer lands where there's plenty of food this is called migration .,5866,31.9,1
that means when it gets cold out honey the birds fly south to the warm weather that's called migration .,5866,31.9,1
preparing for winter .,5866,31.9,1
in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter .,5866,31.9,1
many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter .,5866,31.9,1
squirrels bury nuts in the fall .,5866,31.9,1
any nuts that a squirrel forgets about may sprout and grow into trees .,5866,31.9,1
i'm not sure what kind of butterfly it is but it's pretty huh .,5866,31.9,1
these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter ?,5866,31.9,1
the best time to use the maps is at around eleven p m on a clear night away from city lights ?,5866,31.9,1
you know mommy and daddy grew up in the city and we never saw any stars because there were so many lights in the city .,5866,31.9,1
but the stars look pretty here ?,5866,31.9,1
and one day when you were a little tiny baby mommy and daddy got you up in the middle of the night and took you out to uh a play ground to look at the stars at night ?,5866,31.9,1
i think there were some shooting stars or something like that ?,5866,31.9,1
but we bundled you up and you were nice and warm .,5866,31.9,1
winter weather ?,5866,31.9,1
in most parts of the winter winter is colder than other seasons ?,5866,31.9,1
the days are shorter and the nights are longer .,5866,31.9,1
in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow .,5866,31.9,1
and some places there may be snow on the ground for several months .,5866,31.9,1
this is neat this says how to make a snow shaker .,5866,31.9,1
yeah that's very neat .,5866,31.9,1
stormy skies .,5866,31.9,1
water colors are very good for painting moody skies and clouds .,5866,31.9,1
especially if you wet the paper first .,5866,31.9,1
before you start a picture try some of the ideas shown below to find out how to create different effects .,5866,31.9,1
look at this you can make clouds .,5866,31.9,1
ooh and there's a castle .,5866,31.9,1
and stormy stormy air ?,5866,31.9,1
winter buds ?,5866,31.9,1
in the winter trees hardly grow at all but slow down and rest ?,5866,31.9,1
i think it's a tree actually with a little bud ?,5866,31.9,1
all these look at all these different little sticks with things growing on them huh .,5866,31.9,1
let's see if we can find our tree in the back .,5866,31.9,1
our tree's a red oak tree .,5866,31.9,1
i don't see any oaks here .,5866,31.9,1
here's a turkey oak maybe that's sort of ?,5866,31.9,1
sort of like ours .,5866,31.9,1
look at all those beautiful green leaves .,5866,31.9,1
that's an oak leaf .,5866,31.9,1
that's kinda like what falls from our tree .,5866,31.9,1
that's kinda brown and then these are green right .,5866,31.9,1
winter trees .,5866,31.9,1
trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees .,5866,31.9,1
well you learn something every day huh .,5866,31.9,1
almost all of them have broad flat leaves .,5866,31.9,1
deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring ?,5866,31.9,1
do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles ?,5866,31.9,1
or manny rakes them up for us because he's better at it than we are ?,5866,31.9,1
winter flowers oh look at all .,5866,31.9,1
few plants flower in the winter because frost and ice harm them but toward the end of the winter when it starts to get warmer the first flowers appeal ?,5866,31.9,1
look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands .,5866,31.9,1
the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here .,5866,31.9,1
when winter is over ?,5866,31.9,1
camellias those are pretty huh .,5866,31.9,1
they do look like roses they do ?,5866,31.9,1
baked potatos .,5866,31.9,1
oh those are tomatoes you're right those are tomatoes and these are potatos !,5866,31.9,1
baked potatos are one of the easiest things to cook and make a warming meal on a winter's day .,5866,31.9,1
below are ?,5866,31.9,1
they're potatos .,5866,31.9,1
do they look like little rocks .,5866,31.9,1
okay this does not sound good to mommy ?,5866,31.9,1
below are two suggestions for different fillings ?,5866,31.9,1
tuna and sweet corn ?,5866,31.9,1
does that sound good to you tuna and corn in a potato .,5866,31.9,1
really it doesn't sound so good to mommy .,5866,31.9,1
but you know maybe it's good but ?,5866,31.9,1
it kind of looks like someone threw up ?,5866,31.9,1
but don't let me hold you back !,5866,31.9,1
cheese and bacon ooh doesn't that sound good cheese and bacon on a potato ?,5866,31.9,1
that sounds good to me does it sound good to you .,5866,31.9,1
cheese and bacon you like bacon don't you .,5866,31.9,1
so this is how you bake ?,5866,31.9,1
make a baked potato sweetie !,5866,31.9,1
you wash your potato .,5866,31.9,1
and you poke it with a fork .,5866,31.9,1
and you put it in a hot oven ?,5866,31.9,1
and then it gets all cooked and you cut it open and you can fill it with things ?,5866,31.9,1
bird watching .,5866,31.9,1
it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge .,5866,31.9,1
this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand .,5866,31.9,1
know what we should probably do honey .,5866,31.9,1
i think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some .,5866,31.9,1
and then we could see some really neat birds .,5866,31.9,1
maybe we could see a blue jay .,5866,31.9,1
or a cardinal ?,5866,31.9,1
oh look it says here we can put bread or cheese or potato or bacon ?,5866,31.9,1
birds like bacon too .,5866,31.9,1
everybody likes bacon .,5866,31.9,1
except for maybe a pig .,5866,31.9,1
surviving the winter .,5866,31.9,1
different animals have different ways of coping with the cold weather and lack of food in winter .,5866,31.9,1
some of them go to sleep all winter that's called hibernation .,5866,31.9,1
others have thick coats to keep them warm so they can continue looking for food throughout the winter .,5866,31.9,1
that's a little sleeping hedgehog .,5866,31.9,1
this is a marmot .,5866,31.9,1
it's an alpine marmot .,5866,31.9,1
alpine marmots seal themselves into their burrows underground and sleep for the winter .,5866,31.9,1
that is they sleep for half the year .,5866,31.9,1
six months .,5866,31.9,1
well that's right caterpillars will turn into butterflies right .,5866,31.9,1
bugs that's right sometimes they shed their skin ?,5866,31.9,1
let's see what it says about summer and spring okay ?,5866,31.9,1
yeah but this would be a pretty thing to make one day .,5866,31.9,1
we should make this with phoebe i bet she would like to make these don't you think .,5866,31.9,1
would you like to take your cinderella wig off sweetie .,5866,31.9,1
looks pretty snazzy ?,5866,31.9,1
planting seeds did we plant .,5866,31.9,1
we planted some things in the backyard didn't we .,5866,31.9,1
plant flower seeds indoors early in spring and they will flower in the summer .,5866,31.9,1
here you can see how to grow pansies from seeds but you can plant most other small flower seeds in the same way .,5866,31.9,1
you fill the little containers with soil .,5866,31.9,1
and you put two little seeds in each section .,5866,31.9,1
cover the box with newspaper and leave it outside .,5866,31.9,1
water every few days .,5866,31.9,1
after two weeks shoots will appear ?,5866,31.9,1
that is very very interesting .,5866,31.9,1
i did not even know that .,5866,31.9,1
and put them in a big pot .,5866,31.9,1
is that a bad piece .,5866,31.9,1
you don't like the crust honey ?,5866,31.9,1
of the bread .,5866,31.9,1
you know what i don't have any more bread those were our last two slices mommy has to go buy some more bread .,5866,31.9,1
i don't have any more but i can get you something else .,5866,31.9,1
oh look at this from tadpole to frog .,5866,31.9,1
well i don't have any more toast sweetie pie !,5866,31.9,1
we have to go to the supermarket to buy it ?,5866,31.9,1
oh that is a beetle ?,5866,31.9,1
that's a swimming beetle ?,5866,31.9,1
whoops watch out for your ?,5866,31.9,1
from tadpole to frog ?,5866,31.9,1
early in the spring frogs lay their eggs which are called frog spawn ?,5866,31.9,1

that's a newt ?,5866,31.9,1
it's a newt .,5866,31.9,1

frogs lay their eggs in .,5866,31.9,1
and those are newts .,5866,31.9,1
wanna hear about frogs how frogs grow .,5866,31.9,1
frogs lay their eggs in clumps of clear jelly which float to the surface of the pond .,5866,31.9,1
yeah that's kind of a little weird .,5866,31.9,1
after about ten days tadpoles wiggle out .,5866,31.9,1
that's what they look like it kind of looks .,5866,31.9,1
sort of looks like a frog but sort of looks like a fish !,5866,31.9,1
and they swim in search of food .,5866,31.9,1
the tadpoles then grow legs .,5866,31.9,1
and they come to the surface of the water to breathe .,5866,31.9,1
after twelve or thirteen weeks the tadpoles have turned into tiny frogs .,5866,31.9,1
wow that's neat ?,5866,31.9,1
oh look at all these eggs that you can decorate look how pretty these are ?,5866,31.9,1
that's right with matt and aunt jill hid all sorts of yummy treats didn't she in the eggs .,5866,31.9,1

butterfly that's right .,5866,31.9,1
spring is a good ?,5866,31.9,1
that's a caterpillar ?,5866,31.9,1
spring is a ?,5866,31.9,1
caterpillar caterpillar .,5866,31.9,1
spring is a good time to look for caterpillars you might spot some in a garden or out in the country .,5866,31.9,1
many of them live on leaves but you may also find one wiggling across a path in search of its food plant .,5866,31.9,1
he is looking at you .,5866,31.9,1
the tiny caterpillar eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger .,5866,31.9,1
and then it makes a hard case called a pupa around itself .,5866,31.9,1
or a cocoon .,5866,31.9,1
and when it comes out .,5866,31.9,1
well this is the little cocoon they make around themselves and when they come out of the cocoon what are they .,5866,31.9,1
ah a big butterfly or a moth .,5866,31.9,1
well this is a butterfly but a caterpillar can also turn into a moth .,5866,31.9,1
a moth is a moth .,5866,31.9,1
that is tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with fresh basil .,5866,31.9,1
yes and you love cheese too so that's just delicious .,5866,31.9,1

maybe we should do that next year ?,5866,31.9,1
yes tomatoes are red so delicious ?,5866,31.9,1
yeah delicious .,5866,31.9,1
hm summer flowers oh that's very pretty .,5866,31.9,1
uh bug watch .,5866,31.9,1
beetles have hardened front wings that protect their delicate flying wings .,5866,31.9,1
look for them under bark .,5866,31.9,1
um that's another type that's called a devil's coach horse beetle .,5866,31.9,1
and this is a green shield beetle .,5866,31.9,1
and this is a click beetle .,5866,31.9,1
that apparently is a cockchafer beetle .,5866,31.9,1

wow you're right .,5866,31.9,1
um beetles eat all kinds of plants and animals and there are thousands of different beetles living everywhere ?,5866,31.9,1
ants live together in enormous groups called colonies and they make nests by burrowing in sand or soil .,5866,31.9,1
if you watch where a line of ants goes you will probably find their nest hole .,5866,31.9,1
the ants work hard carrying food and other things back to the colony ?,5866,31.9,1
they leave a scent trail between the food they find and the nest so the rest of the ants will know which way they went .,5866,31.9,1
bees there's a little bumble bee ?,5866,31.9,1
bees feed on nectar a sweet liquid found inside most flowers .,5866,31.9,1
most bees gather nectar from one type of flower at a time .,5866,31.9,1
as a bee flies from flower to flower it also gathers pollen .,5866,31.9,1
the sticky yellow dust inside flowers ?,5866,31.9,1
it carries the pollen to other flowers and this helps the flowers to make new seeds ?,5866,31.9,1
okay you hold the bug page open honey ?,5866,31.9,1
when i come back are you gonna tell me something great about bugs ?,5866,31.9,1

we may have to stop at the mall okay .,5866,31.9,1
did you learn anything exciting about bugs while i was gone .,5866,31.9,1
what did you learn ?,5866,31.9,1
did you find did you learn that let's see .,5866,31.9,1
dragonflies fly .,5866,31.9,1
those are ants ?,5866,31.9,1
dragonflies fly low above ponds and streams early in the summer .,5866,31.9,1
their brightly colored bodies flash as they swoop across the water chasing insects .,5866,31.9,1
you may see them resting on leaves their wings outstretched in the sun .,5866,31.9,1
butterflies and moths are attracted to brightly colored scented flowers .,5866,31.9,1
like bees they feed on nectar ?,5866,31.9,1
watch how they stretch .,5866,31.9,1
yeah there's a butterfly .,5866,31.9,1
okay uh snail trail .,5866,31.9,1
snails live in damp shady places and are easy to find .,5866,31.9,1
a damp shady place that's where they like .,5866,31.9,1
damp is like kind of wet .,5866,31.9,1
let mommy get a paper towel sweets .,5866,31.9,1
snails slither along the ground ?,5866,31.9,1
snail trail .,5866,31.9,1
snails slither along the ground leaving a trail of slime behind them .,5866,31.9,1
slime .,5866,31.9,1

kind of yucky but neat too right ?,5866,31.9,1
that is very ?,5866,31.9,1
oh the slime the slime ?,5866,31.9,1
well you could touch some that's true i guess .,5866,31.9,1
snails usually come out to feed at night or after rain .,5866,31.9,1
this is because their skin is not waterproof !,5866,31.9,1

that's the snail .,5866,31.9,1
and that's his shell ?,5866,31.9,1
in the winter or hot weather snails hide in shady spots they close themselves into their shells with slime .,5866,31.9,1
most snails feed on plants and are especially fond of soft growing shoots .,5866,31.9,1
if you go to a beach you can have fun looking for shells pebbles and other treasures .,5866,31.9,1
it's best to explore at low tide when the sea is out .,5866,31.9,1
try looking along the line of seaweed that marks the high water level ?,5866,31.9,1

mushroom time .,5866,31.9,1
harvest time .,5866,31.9,1
many different foods and drinks are made from plants .,5866,31.9,1
fruit and vegetables come from plants but so do other everyday foods such as flour coffee cocoa oil and sugar .,5866,31.9,1
you make chocolate out of cocoa beans .,5866,31.9,1
most plant foods are grown as crops and are picked or harvested in the summer .,5866,31.9,1
look for combine harvesters working in the fields late in the summer .,5866,31.9,1
these huge machines harvest crops such as wheat oats rye and barley ?,5866,31.9,1
that are grown for their seeds or grain .,5866,31.9,1
combine harvesters don't just cut they crop they also gather it together and separate the grain from the stalk ?,5866,31.9,1

if the sun comes out between clouds when it's raining it shines through the drops of water and you may suddenly see a rainbow .,5866,31.9,1
rainbows are always on the opposite side of the sky from the sun so you have to stand with your back to the sun to see them .,5866,31.9,1
colors in a rainbow are always in the same order .,5866,31.9,1
red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet .,5866,31.9,1
in spring the weather can change very quickly .,5866,31.9,1
strong winds and sudden showers are often followed by rainbows or sunshine .,5866,31.9,1

she has lots of teeth .,5880,36.3,2
she has lots of dimes and quarters too .,5880,36.3,2
she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow .,5880,36.3,2
and she puts the money there instead .,5880,36.3,2
sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money .,5880,36.3,2
that this is because she works so hard ?,5880,36.3,2
the tooth fairy has to work harder than the easter bunny because the easter bunny only works on easter .,5880,36.3,2
the tooth fairy works harder than santa claus because there's only one night when santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth fairy is busy every night .,5880,36.3,2

she just loves jewelry ?,5880,36.3,2
of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth fairy .,5880,36.3,2
the pathway to her house is paved with teeth .,5880,36.3,2
and there are always stars outside her window at night .,5880,36.3,2
at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes lines full of teeth in the sky just in case the real stars don't come out .,5880,36.3,2

what kinds of medicine did you take isabelle ?,5978,38.6,2
she slept .,5978,38.6,2
today is friday june fourth two thousand four !,5978,38.6,2
isabelle scratched on the wall ?,5978,38.6,2
that's cause she hasn't had her second breakfast yet ?,5978,38.6,2
isabelle would you like a new puzzle ?,5978,38.6,2
it has a certain somebody on it that you like .,5978,38.6,2
wanna do it together ?,5978,38.6,2
let's do it in the hall ?,5978,38.6,2
what kind of a creature is that ?,5978,38.6,2
now we can put it together but you know we're gonna have to take it up so the floor can be washed a little later .,5978,38.6,2
should we do it somewhere where we don't have to pick it up ?,5978,38.6,2
i wonder how big it is ?,5978,38.6,2
finished size ten and a third by fourteen and a half ?,5978,38.6,2
i wonder if we had a really big board we could use it .,5978,38.6,2
i have a tray we could do it in .,5978,38.6,2
whoop did that come off ?,5978,38.6,2
i'm gonna put it on your bottom .,5978,38.6,2
you know what i was thinking .,5978,38.6,2
i was thinking a little later if you want we could go to earthly delights for you second breakfast .,5978,38.6,2
she could come .,5978,38.6,2
i think naima this tray will work for this puzzle .,5978,38.6,2
that way we can move it around and take it off the floor when we're done .,5978,38.6,2
see this little tray with the elephants on it ?,5978,38.6,2
i'm gonna go get the tape recorder and bring it in here .,5978,38.6,2
here are all the pieces ?,5978,38.6,2
spread them all out and put them all face up .,5978,38.6,2
i'll be right back emma .,5978,38.6,2
no we're gonna do it together .,5978,38.6,2
where's my mic ?,5978,38.6,2
yeah we'll do it together .,5978,38.6,2
um it's plastic actually .,5978,38.6,2
alright let's look at that picture that it's supposed to look like .,5978,38.6,2
mm this looks like kind of a hard puzzle ?,5978,38.6,2
you know what the easiest place to start i think would be .,5978,38.6,2
see how there's pink flowers only on the left side of the picture .,5978,38.6,2
why don't we find all the pieces that have part of the pink flower in them .,5978,38.6,2
well put it on the tray .,5978,38.6,2
we're gonna make it on the tray so that we can move it when we're done if we want to .,5978,38.6,2
there's pink flower ?,5978,38.6,2
here's some pink flower ?,5978,38.6,2
here's some too ?,5978,38.6,2
first i'm just finding all the pieces !,5978,38.6,2
up there's a tiny bit of pink flower in that piece .,5978,38.6,2
this puzzle has sixty pieces .,5978,38.6,2
you put three of the pink flower pieces together .,5978,38.6,2
well this needs to be an edge doesn't it .,5978,38.6,2
excuse me your hair and head is right in the way .,5978,38.6,2
i can't see the puzzle at all .,5978,38.6,2
see that's that edge !,5978,38.6,2
and here's a bud .,5978,38.6,2
where's this flower bud in the picture ?,5978,38.6,2
oh it's down there .,5978,38.6,2
so i think this is a bottom piece .,5978,38.6,2
up here's another flower piece .,5978,38.6,2
oh you made it connect .,5978,38.6,2
this one goes down here because it's this bud ?,5978,38.6,2
there's two birds so let's look for ?,5978,38.6,2
let's find all the bird pieces next .,5978,38.6,2
i just put all the bird pieces in one spot for now .,5978,38.6,2
uh sorry .,5978,38.6,2
bird mird .,5978,38.6,2
hey we got a lot of pieces together .,5978,38.6,2
some fruit of some kind .,5978,38.6,2
there's a bird near this petal .,5978,38.6,2
i think is it .,5978,38.6,2
yeah this bird must be near this ?,5978,38.6,2
and this bird should have more bird body .,5978,38.6,2
does this go to this .,5978,38.6,2
i think this part .,5978,38.6,2
this is this other bird .,5978,38.6,2
let's find the birds .,5978,38.6,2
here's a bird's beak ?,5978,38.6,2
and this might go here .,5978,38.6,2
i think this piece .,5978,38.6,2
i think i found a beak over there .,5978,38.6,2
all that piece has is beak .,5978,38.6,2
this is another part of a bird .,5978,38.6,2
do you think it goes here ?,5978,38.6,2
i think we could find a corner piece that might .,5978,38.6,2
this is a corner piece that must go up here .,5978,38.6,2
the bird's body is there ?,5978,38.6,2
let's find other corners .,5978,38.6,2
oh wait there's a tiny bit of pink flower .,5978,38.6,2
where is that pink flower ?,5978,38.6,2
does it have one smooth one flat side .,5978,38.6,2
let's look at the picture of the cover on the cover and see where a piece of bud belongs .,5978,38.6,2
i got that one up here .,5978,38.6,2
and there's fur on it ?,5978,38.6,2
oh here's another edge i mean corner piece .,5978,38.6,2
i wonder if that's the corner piece for the bottom left .,5978,38.6,2
i think upside down and sideways .,5978,38.6,2
and i think this corner piece might go .,5978,38.6,2
oh wait maybe not .,5978,38.6,2
i think maybe this is the corner piece for this side .,5978,38.6,2
i don't know if it goes there .,5978,38.6,2
i think we need more fur .,5978,38.6,2
we need a bottom piece with more fur .,5978,38.6,2
now see if this corner piece goes .,5978,38.6,2
mm you need some white to match that .,5978,38.6,2
here's a corner piece .,5978,38.6,2
how bout up in this part ?,5978,38.6,2
we're still missing one more corner piece ?,5978,38.6,2
let's find the corner piece .,5978,38.6,2
wait this is a corner piece ?,5978,38.6,2
this must go here .,5978,38.6,2
probably missing one edge piece here ?,5978,38.6,2
hm there's a side piece .,5978,38.6,2
well it's gotta go right on the edge doesn't it .,5978,38.6,2
along that edge i think .,5978,38.6,2
i think that's a black ear .,5978,38.6,2
i think that goes up here .,5978,38.6,2
see look there's the black ear .,5978,38.6,2
so that's the top part .,5978,38.6,2
feels like we're missing pieces though .,5978,38.6,2
are we sitting on any .,5978,38.6,2
you were sitting on one piece .,5978,38.6,2
oh it looks like the other .,5978,38.6,2
is it the other ear .,5978,38.6,2
or part of this ear .,5978,38.6,2
check here ?,5978,38.6,2
does it fit in to that !,5978,38.6,2
and that goes there ?,5978,38.6,2
the whole top edge is done now ?,5978,38.6,2
naima how about if that .,5978,38.6,2
yeah is it right ?,5978,38.6,2
it's too loose to fit .,5978,38.6,2
i don't think we have a place to put that one yet .,5978,38.6,2
it looks like an ear .,5978,38.6,2
maybe it's the other .,5978,38.6,2
maybe it goes ?,5978,38.6,2
look and see how the brown branch connects to the black ear ?,5978,38.6,2
that's this right here .,5978,38.6,2
it does go there ?,5978,38.6,2
i think so whoop .,5978,38.6,2
i checked .,5978,38.6,2
i'll check again if you want me to .,5978,38.6,2
those two go ?,5978,38.6,2
no they don't go .,5978,38.6,2
they look like they go but they don't .,5978,38.6,2
no it doesn't go .,5978,38.6,2
let's find more edge pieces .,5978,38.6,2
there have to be at least a few .,5978,38.6,2
this is an edge piece this is an edge piece this is an edge piece .,5978,38.6,2
oh a very small amount of pink aha .,5978,38.6,2
sometimes you just have to try a lot of pieces and see what what fits .,5978,38.6,2
does that go .,5978,38.6,2
yeah i guess it does go .,5978,38.6,2
oh we still need some edge pieces to be found .,5978,38.6,2
this is another edge piece .,5978,38.6,2
where it goes i don't know ?,5978,38.6,2
how bout there ?,5978,38.6,2
oh that goes ?,5978,38.6,2
oh i wonder if this now goes here .,5978,38.6,2
it's starting to look more like the picture isn't it .,5978,38.6,2
some black we need an edge piece that has a little black in it ?,5978,38.6,2
but that didn't look like an edge piece .,5978,38.6,2
this is an edge piece !,5978,38.6,2
oh hm an ear ?,5978,38.6,2
how about on there ?,5978,38.6,2
will it attach to that ear .,5978,38.6,2
you were right it doesn't go there .,5978,38.6,2
certainly the first time you do a puzzle is the hardest i think ?,5978,38.6,2
daddy will be very surprised .,5978,38.6,2
all that bluish .,5978,38.6,2
i still don't understand what piece goes there though .,5978,38.6,2
cause there's a lot of fur involved .,5978,38.6,2
i think we're missing an edge piece that has black in it .,5978,38.6,2
those don't have any edges .,5978,38.6,2
well i hope we weren't missing a piece when it was a new puzzle .,5978,38.6,2
let's lift up and look and see if we .,5978,38.6,2
somehow did we miss some .,5978,38.6,2
look behind you where the other box is .,5978,38.6,2
are there any pieces under that .,5978,38.6,2
okay maybe we're just missing a piece .,5978,38.6,2
well we could still put together most of it .,5978,38.6,2
even if we're missing .,5978,38.6,2
well i wanna keep going .,5978,38.6,2
i wanna keep going and see what we can do ?,5978,38.6,2
maybe this maybe this connects over here .,5978,38.6,2
oh this goes here .,5978,38.6,2
i think this goes here .,5978,38.6,2
oh is it part of an ear ?,5978,38.6,2
does it go over here .,5978,38.6,2
it's got white .,5978,38.6,2
the white is part of the face of the panda .,5978,38.6,2
it's a little bit loose .,5978,38.6,2
it's a very white part ?,5978,38.6,2
but with a little black .,5978,38.6,2
i'm not sure we have a place for that .,5978,38.6,2
where does the panda have stripes ?,5978,38.6,2
oh that's not a stripe that's the panda's jaw .,5978,38.6,2
so that goes somewhere here .,5978,38.6,2
jaw piece ?,5978,38.6,2
actually that looks right ?,5978,38.6,2
oh that's the nose where .,5978,38.6,2
see where it gets very very bluish white .,5978,38.6,2
that must be the nose ?,5978,38.6,2
try over here naima .,5978,38.6,2
oh no i guess not .,5978,38.6,2
we got two ears already .,5978,38.6,2
oh here's another edge piece ?,5978,38.6,2
it's really hard to spot them .,5978,38.6,2
that goes there i think .,5978,38.6,2
this go here ?,5978,38.6,2
oh but this goes here .,5978,38.6,2
and this goes here .,5978,38.6,2
and we need one more edge piece right there .,5978,38.6,2
it must have some white and some black do you see ?,5978,38.6,2
well that goes there .,5978,38.6,2
and this goes this way .,5978,38.6,2
we're getting there naima .,5978,38.6,2
i think more than half the pieces are put together .,5978,38.6,2
and it has to be an edge too .,5978,38.6,2
this is an edge !,5978,38.6,2
try that on the side there .,5978,38.6,2
okay that means we've done all the edges .,5978,38.6,2
all four edges .,5978,38.6,2
that's something .,5978,38.6,2
at least we did that .,5978,38.6,2
it's pretty white isn't it .,5978,38.6,2
it's like putting the cars down in the right street .,5978,38.6,2
that goes very nicely right there .,5978,38.6,2
something must go there somehow ?,5978,38.6,2
hm it must have some sky and it must have some white .,5978,38.6,2
so the bluish and the white it has to have .,5978,38.6,2
bluish and has to have some white .,5978,38.6,2
oh and it has to have a tiny bit of black !,5978,38.6,2
how bout over here naima ?,5978,38.6,2
well maybe not ?,5978,38.6,2
this is not a particularly easy puzzle is it .,5978,38.6,2
i'm gonna try this here ?,5978,38.6,2
how bout there ?,5978,38.6,2
oh no maybe not cause that's its belly ?,5978,38.6,2
it has to be a place where there's blue sky .,5978,38.6,2
it might go over here somewhere .,5978,38.6,2
daddy left his tv on downstairs ?,5978,38.6,2
let's see that has some white fur and some black .,5978,38.6,2
oh that has the eye naima .,5978,38.6,2
you've got the eye piece .,5978,38.6,2
how bout there ?,5978,38.6,2
well the other eye should be over here somewhere .,5978,38.6,2
yes i know i know .,5978,38.6,2
we only have one two three four five .,5978,38.6,2
i think we have nine .,5978,38.6,2
you have a runny nose again .,5978,38.6,2
try this corner .,5978,38.6,2
we did the whole puzzle .,5978,38.6,2
sixty pieces .,5978,38.6,2
no let's not .,5978,38.6,2
this way we can save it and put it up if we want to save it to look at .,5978,38.6,2
we didn't !,5978,38.6,2
yep could you count how many more we could fit if we wanted to .,5978,38.6,2
you only need .,5978,38.6,2
you actually don't have very many more .,5978,38.6,2
well if we get some more they'll have a place there won't they ?,5978,38.6,2
you just got !,5978,38.6,2
you just did a new one sweetie ?,5978,38.6,2
i think we should open the window a little cause it's so nice outside .,5978,38.6,2
these windows do have screens .,5978,38.6,2
we don't have to worry about that .,5978,38.6,2
i see naima's knight over there ?,5978,38.6,2
naima's knight .,5978,38.6,2
i think you actually probably have it memorized .,5978,38.6,2
you know that book so well .,5978,38.6,2
naima's knight .,5978,38.6,2
look at all the stickers .,5978,38.6,2
why does it have all those stickers on .,5978,38.6,2
why did you put stickers on ?,5978,38.6,2
you're a fierce .,5978,38.6,2

little tiny cub !,5978,38.6,2
you're gonna be born ?,5978,38.6,2

it probably looks very bright when you come out .,5978,38.6,2
what's your name little baby ?,5978,38.6,2
you don't wanna decide .,5978,38.6,2
your name's gonna be isabelle .,5978,38.6,2

sophie's tiniest dolls dashed out of the dollhouse and the toys that had been put into the toy box jumped down from it ?,6030,44.8,2
let's play suggested big ted .,6030,44.8,2
this is fun said sophie .,6030,44.8,2
as she played games with her toys would you like to do that violet .,6030,44.8,2
is that how she's gonna get her panda .,6030,44.8,2
oh yeah i don't know .,6030,44.8,2
where's peter asked sophie suddenly ?,6030,44.8,2
they looked everywhere but peter the panda was no where to be found .,6030,44.8,2
they gazed at each other in dismay then sophie heard a soft noise .,6030,44.8,2
everyone stood still and listened ?,6030,44.8,2
someone's calling said the fairy doll who had very good hearing .,6030,44.8,2
it's coming from the top of the bookcase said sophie .,6030,44.8,2
they crowded beneath the bookcase a tiny black and white head appeared over the top high above them it was peter the panda .,6030,44.8,2
i'm stuck he squeaked in a tiny voice .,6030,44.8,2
gosh said sophie i must have put you there when i was told to straighten up my room .,6030,44.8,2
please get me down begged peter the panda but how asked sophie .,6030,44.8,2
the bookcase is so high and we're so little .,6030,44.8,2
what can they do violet ?,6030,44.8,2
you know what i think they should do .,6030,44.8,2
i think she should go back on her horse and get big again and then she can just walk right over to it and pick it up right .,6030,44.8,2
i know a way said big ted he ran off and came back pushing sophie's toy fire engine we can use this what a good idea ?,6030,44.8,2
it stretched higher and higher into the air just the way a real fire engine's ladder does until the very top of it was resting against the bookcase .,6030,44.8,2
now climb down peter shouted samantha .,6030,44.8,2
oh no i can't said peter don't worry said big ted i'll get him down .,6030,44.8,2
he climbed up the ladder and lifted peter onto his shoulders ?,6030,44.8,2
everybody cheered and clapped when big ted carried peter safely to the ground ?,6030,44.8,2
thank you said sophie hugging big ted and kissing his cheek .,6030,44.8,2
just then the clock on the bedroom wall went cuckoo .,6030,44.8,2
aha said sophie it's time for bed i have to go .,6030,44.8,2
bye bye toys thank you .,6030,44.8,2
goodbye shouted the toys .,6030,44.8,2
please come again .,6030,44.8,2
sophie climbed onto the back of the magic rocking horse and began to rock .,6030,44.8,2
in an instant she was back in her bedroom a big girl again .,6030,44.8,2
big ted and little ted were slumped at the foot of the bed .,6030,44.8,2
the fire engine with samantha the doll leaning against it was down on the floor .,6030,44.8,2
the rest of the toys were all back in their normal places ?,6030,44.8,2
it seemed as though sophie's adventure in toy land never happened ?,6030,44.8,2
the sash of her bathrobe was still dangling down the side of the bed and peter the panda was lying safe on sophie's pillow .,6030,44.8,2
lucky sophie had been to toy land she had a delightful adventure with all her toys and she had found peter and panda too ?,6030,44.8,2
now she couldn't wait to go to bed ?,6030,44.8,2
peter the panda .,6030,44.8,2
she couldn't wait to go to bed and dream about her wonderful adventure ?,6030,44.8,2
hey i think it was a dream do you .,6030,44.8,2
and she woke up and she had her she had her bear with her .,6030,44.8,2
max do you want me to get the legos out for you to play for a little while .,6030,44.8,2
because i wanted to do a puzzle with violet violet you wanna do the dinosaur floor puzzle with me while max does his legos for a few minutes .,6030,44.8,2
unicorn one .,6030,44.8,2
the spring unicorn .,6030,44.8,2
okay then that's it because these are long ones ?,6030,44.8,2
far away beyond the widest oceans lies the enchanted land of feria .,6030,44.8,2
the people of feria are always happy for the summers are long the falls are beautiful the springs are a joy and the winters although a little cold are short .,6030,44.8,2
it is such a beautiful place and the crops grow so well that there is little for the ferian people to do but enjoy themselves in the sun .,6030,44.8,2
so they rarely work and instead spend their days playing having parties making music and telling each other wonderful stories ?,6030,44.8,2
hey i wanna go there do you ?,6030,44.8,2
some people might say that they are lazy but they wouldn't care because they're just so happy .,6030,44.8,2
but one year it wasn't like that .,6030,44.8,2
that year in fact the people of feria were far from happy indeed they were very worried .,6030,44.8,2
for although spring should have arrived weeks before it hadn't none of the winter snows were gone yet .,6030,44.8,2
and lakes had not thawed the birds were not building their nests and the buds of the flowers in the mountain meadows had had failed to open .,6030,44.8,2
not good enough said the king something must be done .,6030,44.8,2
which one you think's the king violet .,6030,44.8,2
let violet choose please maxwell ?,6030,44.8,2
which one do you think violet .,6030,44.8,2
the same as he said ?,6030,44.8,2
i was gonna guess that guy .,6030,44.8,2
he looks older and he was the one talking but then when max pointed to that one i think he's right because that one has the crown on .,6030,44.8,2
but it's funny the king's usually old isn't he .,6030,44.8,2
all the men and women of great council except for one shook their heads for they did not know the answer but the oldest and wisest member stood up .,6030,44.8,2
it is because the spring unicorn the bringer of spring has not visited feria this year he explained without his arrival there can be no spring .,6030,44.8,2
the king and the other members of the council looked at each other and frowned but why has the spring unicorn not come to feria asked the king .,6030,44.8,2
doesn't he like us anymore ?,6030,44.8,2
i think it could be because we are so busy enjoying ourselves that we never thank the spring unicorn for all he does for us it could be that he thinks we are lazy and don't deserve to live in such a wonderful place suggested the wisest council member ?,6030,44.8,2
but we must pay that put that right at once said the king all the people in the land must leave the warmth of their homes and go out and start work immediately ?,6030,44.8,2
they must start um they must um .,6030,44.8,2
the king wanted to describe the sorts of things that people should be doing when they went out to work but the trouble was he knew nothing about work so he didn't know what to say .,6030,44.8,2
finally he said they er they must you know they must bustle about being busy doing work and things .,6030,44.8,2
do you know what a work thing is violet ?,6030,44.8,2
sweeping is one kind of work do you know any other kind of work .,6030,44.8,2
in the winter yeah that's a type of work in the winter .,6030,44.8,2
digging too yep so because the king told them to the people of feria went to work at first they didn't even know what to do .,6030,44.8,2
then when they looked up the word in the feria dictionary and they found out what was involved they didn't like the sound of it and grumbled a lot among themselves .,6030,44.8,2
but as time passed they discovered that they actually enjoyed being busy they shoveled the snow from the paths in their gardens they cleared snow from the roads .,6030,44.8,2
they repaired leaking roofs and they even filled all the holes in the road ?,6030,44.8,2
and they still laughed and sang the way they used to before the spring failed to arrive and the king ordered them all to go to work .,6030,44.8,2
but it still kept snowing and the lakes didn't thaw and the birds failed to build their nests and the flowers didn't bloom .,6030,44.8,2
what can be the matter now the king asked the oldest and wisest member of his council ?,6030,44.8,2
perhaps the spring unicorn doesn't know how hard we are working said the wise man .,6030,44.8,2
well the spring unicorn must be told snapped the king stamping his royal feet .,6030,44.8,2
that very day messengers were sent throughout the land to put up posters announcing that anyone who found the spring unicorn and explained how hard the ferians had been working would receive all the gold they could wish for .,6030,44.8,2
the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived ?,6030,44.8,2
do you know where he lives violet ?,6030,44.8,2
and where's that .,6030,44.8,2
what do you call that place you think ?,6030,44.8,2
he lives in the same place .,6030,44.8,2
how come they couldn't find him then ?,6030,44.8,2
oh they didn't see him ?,6030,44.8,2
he lives in the valley .,6030,44.8,2
the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived ?,6030,44.8,2
nobody that was except for a poor musician who was known as the whistler ?,6030,44.8,2
i'm fed up with winter and i've got nothing to better to do so i might just as well go and look for the spring unicorn thought the whistler .,6030,44.8,2
see him here .,6030,44.8,2
so he picked up his flute and set off in search of the spring unicorn he traveled far and wide playing his flute to keep him cheerful on his journey .,6030,44.8,2
and as he played the notes of the flute danced before him leading him on and on across the widest ocean over the highest mountains .,6030,44.8,2
i shall follow the notes of my music wherever they lead me he told himself at long last he came to a valley .,6030,44.8,2
hey max you're right .,6030,44.8,2
where no one had ever been before it was the home of the spring unicorn you have no place here boomed a loud voice how how did you a mere ferian find your way here ?,6030,44.8,2
i played my flute and followed the notes explained the whistler .,6030,44.8,2
then he demonstrated with a quick tune .,6030,44.8,2
his music was so beautiful that within minutes a whole herd of magical unicorns appeared and danced before him .,6030,44.8,2
when he had finally laid down his flute one of the unicorns trotted forward he introduced himself as the spring unicorn ?,6030,44.8,2
why are you here the spring unicorn asked .,6030,44.8,2
because you failed to come to feria this year ?,6030,44.8,2
ha exclaimed the spring unicorn i couldn't be bothered to come because the people of feria are so lazy they do not deserve my beautiful springs .,6030,44.8,2
but what you say is no longer true why not violet ?,6030,44.8,2
are the people lazy there .,6030,44.8,2
now they are right .,6030,44.8,2
we are no longer lazy and we still have time to be happy telling each other wonderful tales and playing beautiful music .,6030,44.8,2
maybe you are right said the spring unicorn when the tune had come to an end i'll tell you what i'll do .,6030,44.8,2
providing you play your beautiful music on your journey back to feria i shall accompany you .,6030,44.8,2
and we shall see if the people are no longer lazy .,6030,44.8,2
can i fly on your back asked the whistler hopefully .,6030,44.8,2
no said the spring unicorn if we fly the journey will be over too quickly and i won't have time to listen to all that music i want you to play .,6030,44.8,2
we shall walk back the way you came .,6030,44.8,2
oh drat thought the whistler but how do they walk across the ocean .,6030,44.8,2
that the spring unicorn followed every step of the way .,6030,44.8,2
eventually they arrived in the mountains above feria look .,6030,44.8,2
see them up there .,6030,44.8,2
the whistler pointing down at the village see how hard the people are working .,6030,44.8,2
indeed they were some were shoveling snow from their gardens but as soon as they had finished more snow fell to replace it .,6030,44.8,2
some were clearing snow from the roads .,6030,44.8,2
some were fixing leaks but as soon as they finished more snow fell ?,6030,44.8,2
indeed they are working but are they happy in their work .,6030,44.8,2
listen sad the whistler .,6030,44.8,2
the unicorn listened .,6030,44.8,2
faintly from the village came the sound of someone laughing someone else was whistling .,6030,44.8,2
someone else was singing .,6030,44.8,2
oh yes said the whistler i think you can say they are happy .,6030,44.8,2
i believe you are right you shall have your spring back again .,6030,44.8,2
i shall continue to bring a new spring year after year just as long as the people remain happy and contented and do not ever become lazy again .,6030,44.8,2
and that's how it was and that's how it still is .,6030,44.8,2
and the whistler well he turned down the king's offer of riches in favor of becoming the spring unicorn's helper .,6030,44.8,2
which is why every year the ferian spring is always heralded by the most beautiful music anyone has ever heard .,6030,44.8,2
this one's called floyd the friendly shark we'll read that one later .,6030,44.8,2

a stick bumped it yeah .,7343,45.8,2
this is enough in there ?,7343,45.8,2
oh i see so that's why you thought there was a girl and a boy cause at school you have the girl and the boy .,7343,45.8,2
see i just think this is a smaller set .,7343,45.8,2
at school you probably have more blocks overalright ?,7343,45.8,2
yeah so there's more blocks and then there's two people .,7343,45.8,2
so how did a stick hit your eye ?,7343,45.8,2

it will get crossed ?,7343,45.8,2
i'm not sure what this is for .,7343,45.8,2
i think it's just for the packaging because it would be hard to put all of these in right .,7343,45.8,2
because if i put this part is in the way .,7343,45.8,2
see that's very hard .,7343,45.8,2
do you wanna try to put more on here ?,7343,45.8,2

what's this for you think ?,7343,45.8,2

because it doesn't seem like you are playing with anything right now .,7343,45.8,2
do you want to play with the dinosaur setup like the dinosaur guys ?,7343,45.8,2

yeah i like the long necks .,7343,45.8,2
the other ones kind of scare me a little bit .,7343,45.8,2
but you know i do not know how to take care of a dinosaur .,7343,45.8,2
what do i have to do to take care of him ?,7343,45.8,2
well do you have any green food or any green leaves that i could buy ?,7343,45.8,2
like will he eat this maybe ?,7343,45.8,2
does he eat like a lot or a little ?,7343,45.8,2
so should i buy all these maybe ?,7343,45.8,2
you know i remember in about is he gonna get any bigger ?,7343,45.8,2
oh he's already big alright because i was wondering if ryan should buy a new house to keep him in .,7343,45.8,2
yeah my house isn't very big .,7343,45.8,2
do you think i'm gonna need to buy a new house ?,7343,45.8,2

you know ryan does not know this but our tortoise really is a dinosaur right .,7343,45.8,2
well i hope i have enough room at my house for all of these dinosaurs .,7343,45.8,2
if i don't have enough room would you be able to take one home and let him live at your house ?,7343,45.8,2
i think that i might want to buy one too but which one would you recommend which one ?,7343,45.8,2
which one would be good for my house ?,7343,45.8,2

marky said ?,6460,46.6,2
yeah all the leaves are falling off the trees ?,6460,46.6,2
marky said ?,6460,46.6,2
oh that's for fun right ?,6460,46.6,2

not the other other night he said that night ?,6460,46.6,2
and in fact it had happened last night for sure ?,6460,46.6,2
there is no question that it could of sat there for more than one night ?,6460,46.6,2
and we know that joey did it .,6460,46.6,2
it wasn't somebody but marky was rather inspecific about the whole thing .,6460,46.6,2
unspecific .,6460,46.6,2
marky wanted some ice cream and i said .,6460,46.6,2
and he opened both the refrigerator doors .,6460,46.6,2
if you do that you'll have to go to your room ?,6460,46.6,2
you won't be happy ?,6460,46.6,2
he seems to have his threats pretty well down ?,6460,46.6,2
hey don't forget your cars .,6460,46.6,2
those bad guys are gonna get those cars ?,6460,46.6,2
there's some bad guys that are going to get those cars ?,6460,46.6,2
they're dead ?,6460,46.6,2
not a sarlak ?,6460,46.6,2
does the sarlak have teeth .,6460,46.6,2
does the sarlak have teeth .,6460,46.6,2
does the sarlak have teeth .,6460,46.6,2
does this hole have teeth .,6460,46.6,2
does this hole have teeth .,6460,46.6,2
the one's over there do ?,6460,46.6,2
watch out marky if you walk like that you're going to fall into one of those holes .,6460,46.6,2
you might fall right into one of those holes .,6460,46.6,2
you might fall right in .,6460,46.6,2
are you an invisible person .,6460,46.6,2
no you're not invisible .,6460,46.6,2
you're not invisible you're a little boy ?,6460,46.6,2
mark said this .,6460,46.6,2
tell me about the big one .,6460,46.6,2
why do they get throw ups .,6460,46.6,2
why do they get throw ups .,6460,46.6,2
why do they get throw ups ?,6460,46.6,2
do you know why that happens ?,6460,46.6,2
because they go around so fast and they get dizzy right .,6460,46.6,2
he said this this big brother car is not so allergic to throw ups right ?,6460,46.6,2
which one's not so allergic mark .,6460,46.6,2
the big brother car ?,6460,46.6,2
he was making it go around in circles and they were getting dizzy ?,6460,46.6,2
so this big brother car is not ?,6460,46.6,2
so allergic ?,6460,46.6,2
he's nice to the little brother ?,6460,46.6,2
big brother's nice and good to his little brother ?,6460,46.6,2
and helps the little brother learn .,6460,46.6,2
and plays with him a lot ?,6460,46.6,2
he just gives him a ?,6460,46.6,2
ride or something .,6460,46.6,2
that's a nice big brother isn't it ?,6460,46.6,2
little brother wants to get out he d the fast ones with his little .,6460,46.6,2
if he wants to get in he doose small things .,6460,46.6,2
he does slow .,6460,46.6,2
does he doose them or does he does them .,6460,46.6,2
check it out so he does fast so he's going to do fast fast spins ?,6460,46.6,2
reasoning from the previous premise ?,6460,46.6,2
fast spins because his little ?,6460,46.6,2
brother almost got out ?,6460,46.6,2
his little brother went to play .,6460,46.6,2
with toys at his house .,6460,46.6,2
the big brother has a big house a big full house that's full of what .,6460,46.6,2
so if his brother gets hungry you know .,6460,46.6,2
is he still hungry .,6460,46.6,2
he's not hungry right now okay ?,6460,46.6,2
i'll get the raisins .,6460,46.6,2
mark did you eat breakfast ?,6460,46.6,2
but you want more huh ?,6460,46.6,2
you didn't get enough milk .,6460,46.6,2
okay i'll give you a little more milk .,6460,46.6,2
now you eat that all up okay .,6460,46.6,2
i asked mark if he wanted more milk and i started pouring it for for him ?,6460,46.6,2
i was going to say i was going to say stop ?,6460,46.6,2
do you know you're a good guy ?,6460,46.6,2
yeah a good guy .,6460,46.6,2
yeah a good kid .,6460,46.6,2
that was the reason he was a good guy .,6460,46.6,2
because he didn't kill people .,6460,46.6,2
are you ever mean to children .,6460,46.6,2
you're nice to all the kids at your grade school aren't you .,6460,46.6,2
you're not a bad boy are you .,6460,46.6,2
does your teacher ever have to spank you ?,6460,46.6,2
were you on a chair ?,6460,46.6,2
did you go into a chair .,6460,46.6,2
you were never bad .,6460,46.6,2
you're just only going to be good right .,6460,46.6,2
because you're nice .,6460,46.6,2
no there was no snake in there ?,6460,46.6,2
just a toy snake .,6460,46.6,2
no snake at all ?,6460,46.6,2
that's too bad isn't it .,6460,46.6,2
too bad no snake .,6460,46.6,2
because we like snakes right .,6460,46.6,2
they should be in there somewhere .,7345,46.7,2
maybe check on the bottom shelf i think way in the back there ?,7345,46.7,2
oh my goodness there's actually a lot of them ?,7345,46.7,2
that one's just empty .,7345,46.7,2
wait wait i got a question .,7345,46.7,2

it says crisco ?,7345,46.7,2
they used to use that instead of butter .,7345,46.7,2

chewies do we put chewies in the fridge ?,7345,46.7,2
where do you keep chewies ?,7345,46.7,2
oh in the cabinet oh okay ?,7345,46.7,2
what kind of things do we put in the fridge ?,7345,46.7,2
like the cat .,7345,46.7,2
we put our heads in there .,7345,46.7,2
what would happen to your head if you put it in the fridge ?,7345,46.7,2
it would freeze up .,7345,46.7,2
is there something stuck in there here let me see if i can get it out ?,7345,46.7,2
oh it's another box .,7345,46.7,2
well how do you think we can get it out .,7345,46.7,2
some scissors .,7345,46.7,2
how about that i turned it ?,7345,46.7,2
will that help a little bit .,7345,46.7,2
it has tape on it .,7345,46.7,2
can i try to get it off so you don't end up ripping the box .,7345,46.7,2
let me try to take that little tape off okay .,7345,46.7,2
this means i guess it's never been open huh ?,7345,46.7,2
okay guess let's see what'd you guess is in here ?,7345,46.7,2
a table okay .,7345,46.7,2
here i took the tape off so you could check .,7345,46.7,2
you think it's a couch ?,7345,46.7,2
so now how many couches are there ?,7345,46.7,2
in here there's how many ?,7345,46.7,2
that couch is on the table .,7345,46.7,2
you want me to put them in ?,7345,46.7,2
oh and i get to decorate them decorate the house .,7345,46.7,2
another fridge ?,7345,46.7,2
wow we're gonna have to build another house ?,7345,46.7,2
wow that's a lot of fridges ?,7345,46.7,2
well what room should the should the toilet go in ?,7345,46.7,2
there's not really a bathroom in this house ?,7345,46.7,2
where should we have people ?,7345,46.7,2
it looks like the kids' room .,7345,46.7,2
is that a good place for the toilet ?,7345,46.7,2
probably right in case they have to go in the middle of the night ?,7345,46.7,2
and the bathtub in the kids' room too .,7345,46.7,2
they can just get washed off quick huh ?,7345,46.7,2
they can just go over there ?,7345,46.7,2
alright so we almost have all these things set up ?,7345,46.7,2
people huh ?,7345,46.7,2
people you did find them ?,7345,46.7,2
let's see here i think when we saw ryan last time you and daddy were planning to go somewhere .,7345,46.7,2
do you remember where daddy was going to take you but then we couldn't go ?,7345,46.7,2
do you remember that where daddy was gonna take you to go swimming ?,7345,46.7,2
do you remember where that was ?,7345,46.7,2
you guys were gonna go to the big water park right .,7345,46.7,2
yeah but then they could not go ?,7345,46.7,2
we didn't go to the big water park where did daddy take you .,7345,46.7,2
to a hotel yeah ?,7345,46.7,2
what did you guys do at the hotel ?,7345,46.7,2
you swam there too yeah .,7345,46.7,2
you like swimming ?,7345,46.7,2
do you plug your nose ?,7345,46.7,2
one time you sunk under the water ?,7345,46.7,2
did you get any water in your mouth ?,7345,46.7,2
nope cause he grabbed you so it worked out huh .,7345,46.7,2
so do you have to where anything when you go swimming like something on your arms or something ?,7345,46.7,2
you'll show me if you get it out .,7345,46.7,2
i don't remember a little turtle thing .,7345,46.7,2
is it a raft or something around your waste ?,7345,46.7,2
i don't think i know about this little turtle thing .,7345,46.7,2
books cool .,7345,46.7,2
there's a lot of books ?,7345,46.7,2
i think though that this might be the last one that we should take apart okay ?,7345,46.7,2
you wanna take them all out ?,7345,46.7,2
well it's gonna take like ryan hours to put them all away .,7345,46.7,2
are we gonna help him put them away .,7345,46.7,2
we will though we have to help him because there's gonna be too many to put away ?,7345,46.7,2
we don't even know maybe which boxes to put them in so i think we should probably start cleaning up pretty soon okay .,7345,46.7,2
a couple more minutes ?,7345,46.7,2
i don't think there will be time to get all of them out honey .,7345,46.7,2
we can save them for next time how about ?,7345,46.7,2
in fact what we can do is the one's we haven't opened yet we can set them in a special spot so we know that we haven't opened those ones ?,7345,46.7,2
maybe we can almost hide them then right ?,7345,46.7,2
yeah we'll have to hide them ?,7345,46.7,2
so that roman doesn't come and open them and stuff ?,7345,46.7,2
well if we hide them roman won't find them and he won't open them because you want to be able to open them right .,7345,46.7,2
i wonder how many more fridges there are and how many more toasters .,7345,46.7,2
are those the ones that are left then ?,7345,46.7,2
okay so let's see we still have another chance to open them another time okay .,7345,46.7,2
this is the last box okay so i'll hide these other two okay so we can open the other ones later ?,7345,46.7,2
i'll put them back way back far okay ?,7345,46.7,2
so which one is the last one .,7345,46.7,2
okay that's the last one ?,7345,46.7,2
oh so you gotta put those things in too in where .,7345,46.7,2
okay so we'll put those in ?,7345,46.7,2
i know but look at that .,7345,46.7,2
can people use that furniture .,7345,46.7,2
all we got it it's just gotta fit right .,7345,46.7,2
that would be a funny house to go inside wouldn't it to have all the furniture everywhere .,7345,46.7,2
now where is the people gonna sit down ?,7345,46.7,2
holy smokes ?,7345,46.7,2
let's see now these are ones that we still have yet to open .,7345,46.7,2
because they're kind of behind other things okay ?,7345,46.7,2
you're gonna decorate right you're gonna decide where you want all the little ones ?,7345,46.7,2
it's a really really messy room yeah .,7345,46.7,2
i wonder who's gonna have to clean it all up .,7345,46.7,2
too many things huh .,7345,46.7,2
too many things to clean up ?,7345,46.7,2
what if we did our own house like this ?,7345,46.7,2
that's true there really is no space to walk in that room .,7345,46.7,2
how might somebody sleep on that bed ?,7345,46.7,2
pull themselves on huh ?,7345,46.7,2
they'd have to hold on to the sides here .,7345,46.7,2
oh okay should i still put them back away .,7345,46.7,2
well we'll pick up first and then we can do something else .,7345,46.7,2
you know i'm just kind of worried that they all might just crash onto the floor and then they might break ?,7345,46.7,2
can i grab them .,7345,46.7,2
okay should i take them gently .,7345,46.7,2
i'm just worried about the ones that are porcelain .,7345,46.7,2
like the toilet and the sink thing are made out of porcelain and they could break but i think i got the rest now ?,7345,46.7,2
well the toilet is in the other one .,7345,46.7,2
remember we put it in the kids room ?,7345,46.7,2
the sink is right here .,7345,46.7,2
oh my goodness you got a whole other arm full huh .,7345,46.7,2
lots of couches ?,7345,46.7,2
where should we put the bed do you think ?,7345,46.7,2
there's nothing in there okay ?,7345,46.7,2
oh i think i already put the couch in i think that was one i already put away !,7345,46.7,2
just now i just did when i grabbed when you gave it to me .,7345,46.7,2
hey how's your bedroom doing .,7345,46.7,2
didn't you get something new in your bedroom ?,7345,46.7,2

i thought you were trying to trick me ?,7345,46.7,2
okay i'll close my eyes so i don't see .,7345,46.7,2
can i open them .,7345,46.7,2
there's three in there ?,7345,46.7,2
how'd they all fit ?,7345,46.7,2
boy they're smooshed right in there aren't they ?,7345,46.7,2
they're captured yeah ?,7345,46.7,2
so that actually stays in that room .,7345,46.7,2
can i see how you put in the people .,7345,46.7,2
can i check .,7345,46.7,2
but they're a different set honey ?,7345,46.7,2
does it fit in that one maybe .,7345,46.7,2
they might be too big .,7345,46.7,2
yeah it's too big ?,7345,46.7,2
now they're really captured huh .,7345,46.7,2
they're safe in there you think ?,7345,46.7,2
you want to put that away .,7345,46.7,2
thank you matty .,7345,46.7,2
oh well we still have a couple things to put away honey okay ?,7345,46.7,2
there's not too many left ?,7345,46.7,2
okay i'll leave it open now go ahead look through the house and see what still needs to be put away ?,7345,46.7,2

and then there's animals ?,7345,46.7,2
it's the lion country safari place but remember what did we hear about the monkeys ?,7345,46.7,2
what happens with the monkeys there ?,7345,46.7,2

this book has no words .,6925,48.6,3

and he falls down a little bit .,6925,48.6,3
and now the cat is getting away again going into that .,6925,48.6,3
you've gotta be careful when you're chasing a cat .,6925,48.6,3
and the cat's in a big pipe and they're going after him .,6925,48.6,3
he must have come out the other side and climbed on top .,6925,48.6,3
so we turn the page .,6925,48.6,3
and the cat is up on top and here comes the boy who is a policeman here comes the girl who's a mommy and there goes the cat up the hill getting away .,6925,48.6,3
and the policeman is helping her up right ?,6925,48.6,3
this is a funny book for sure .,6925,48.6,3
and they fall in the water .,6925,48.6,3
and when the cat i guess when the cat comes out the other side the little boy chases the cat cause they chase him through the pipe .,6925,48.6,3
he got away .,6925,48.6,3
and he's scratching the policeman .,6925,48.6,3
that could be .,6925,48.6,3
that could be the little girl's brother .,6925,48.6,3
and there goes the cat up a tree and the policeman .,6925,48.6,3
and he's trying to climb the tree and catch the cat .,6925,48.6,3

you don't want to to do it lying around .,6436,63.3,3
now what do you think barry what happens with barry .,6436,63.3,3
what did you figure out ?,6436,63.3,3
and i said maybe it's true .,6436,63.3,3
maybe there is a commercial .,6436,63.3,3
and you said may be .,6436,63.3,3
the third one .,6436,63.3,3
what is the third one ross ?,6436,63.3,3
the third set .,6436,63.3,3
okay what are the first two sets of he man .,6436,63.3,3
what what are the other sets of he man ?,6436,63.3,3
what set is this ross ?,6436,63.3,3
yeah you already said battle cat ?,6436,63.3,3
okay and what's the other the second bunch .,6436,63.3,3
what does it mean in between ?,6436,63.3,3
how do you know that it's in between ?,6436,63.3,3
how do you know that it's in between ?,6436,63.3,3
why isn't he .,6436,63.3,3
why isn't he in the first bunch .,6436,63.3,3
why isn't he in the first bunch ?,6436,63.3,3
why isn't fakir in the first bunch .,6436,63.3,3
fakir .,6436,63.3,3
yeah why isn't fakir in the first bunch .,6436,63.3,3
he came out when did he come out .,6436,63.3,3
how do you know that he wasn't really in the first bunch how do do you know that he wasn't part of the first bunch ?,6436,63.3,3
he's the last one of the first bunch .,6436,63.3,3
but where do you see him .,6436,63.3,3
where do they and when they make ads where do they put fakir ?,6436,63.3,3
they don't add him anymore .,6436,63.3,3
and what is the third bunch .,6436,63.3,3
and what is the third bunch .,6436,63.3,3
but don't you think that zoar might be flier bird .,6436,63.3,3
what does zoar do ?,6436,63.3,3
what would he be ?,6436,63.3,3
okay now tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch .,6436,63.3,3
supposing i didn't know about them .,6436,63.3,3
oh you don't me to tell you you don't want me to tell .,6436,63.3,3
ross that you didn't figure out ?,6436,63.3,3
you know you know what's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they used to have on the back did fakir ever get in those .,6436,63.3,3
is fakir in the second bunch ?,6436,63.3,3
so they never put fakir in any of the bunches .,6436,63.3,3
yeah the did .,6436,63.3,3
you made a mistake ross ?,6436,63.3,3
at the end of the first bunch they started to sneak fakir into into those pictures .,6436,63.3,3
yup they did .,6436,63.3,3
no it won't show you in the books it was on the backs of the the toys and we didn't save that ?,6436,63.3,3
how would that prove it ?,6436,63.3,3
where are we going to find that ?,6436,63.3,3
you mean at the toy store .,6436,63.3,3
i know how you can tell .,6436,63.3,3
the toys have numbers .,6436,63.3,3
issue numbers .,6436,63.3,3
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers .,6436,63.3,3
you can compare the numbers ?,6436,63.3,3
but the interesting thing is that ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why i just barely realized realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys ?,6436,63.3,3
i'm sure that there will be a third wave .,6436,63.3,3
you mean roots .,6436,63.3,3
an orchid .,6436,63.3,3
isn't he a terrible little brother .,6436,63.3,3
why isn't he as bad as i think he is .,6436,63.3,3
but he does understand some things .,6436,63.3,3
i do understand .,6436,63.3,3
do you understand mark ?,6436,63.3,3
he does understand ?,6436,63.3,3
what does he not understand ?,6436,63.3,3
no earlier you said he doesn't understand infinity and some other things .,6436,63.3,3
no it makes two infinities and eight ?,6436,63.3,3
and that is an unreal number ?,6436,63.3,3
that's a fantasy number ?,6436,63.3,3
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number .,6436,63.3,3
because you could never really get there in reality .,6436,63.3,3
in reality you can get to infinity ?,6436,63.3,3
right because you'd have to live forever .,6436,63.3,3
so it's fantasy .,6436,63.3,3
infinity is fantasy .,6436,63.3,3
good night mom ?,6436,63.3,3

yeah ross i did .,6436,63.3,3
they were messing up the car .,6436,63.3,3
i sure hope todd and his family don't get here too late and miss it .,6436,63.3,3
if they do we'll have to tell them about the exciting part they missed .,6436,63.3,3
one of the guys disappeared just like the wicked witch in the wizard of oz .,6436,63.3,3
how about marian ?,6436,63.3,3
marian didn't do it ?,6436,63.3,3
you go one two three four five six seven eight ?,6436,63.3,3
you you count that way ?,6436,63.3,3
people would get very confused if you went that way ?,6436,63.3,3
it wouldn't work out well .,6436,63.3,3
you could make it up too if you want ?,6436,63.3,3
do they still check you for lice at preschool .,6436,63.3,3
ross was pretending he's a servant he said .,6436,63.3,3

at your servants my king .,6436,63.3,3
the real word is service .,6436,63.3,3
no why ross ?,6436,63.3,3
from your service my king ?,6436,63.3,3
that's cute ross ?,6436,63.3,3
what is a servant ?,6436,63.3,3
what does a servant do ?,6436,63.3,3
kind of like a slave .,6436,63.3,3
but a nice one huh ?,6436,63.3,3
and the king's not mean to him right .,6436,63.3,3

when you were a little boy three years old there were were some things you could do better than what marky can do now ?,6436,63.3,3
like you could tell long stories about star wars .,6436,63.3,3
no and why is that ?,6436,63.3,3
and when do you think they're going to stop .,6436,63.3,3
okay and how about when return of the jedi is finished .,6436,63.3,3
